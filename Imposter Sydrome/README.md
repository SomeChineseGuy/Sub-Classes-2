## Continue to Practice Code & Upskill

You must continue to practice to code whether they are personal hobby projects or learning tutorials. The key to reducing your impostor syndrome is making continuous effort at learning and practice to become more confident of your skill and craft.

## Don't Forget Where you Started

One day, not so long ago, you were just starting. A beginner, that wouldn't be able to pick out an integer from a float. Now you've written full-stack applications, have worked in a team using Git, have not only talked the talk but are walking the walk.

This should not be taken lightly. Don't just look, but feel where you are now compared to that humble beginning. Say it aloud:

> I can write programs. I can read documentation. I can build a web application, and already have!

Spend real time looking back to admire your progress, reflect on the present and what needs to be done, and keep an eye to what is yet to come!

As an example of how far you've come, consider the following piece of code:

```javascript
document.getElementById('contact-form').onSubmit = (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  fetch('https://cat-fact.herokuapp.com/facts')
    .then((data) => data.json())
    .then((facts) => {
      const outputElement = document.getElementById('output');
      facts.forEach((fact) => {
        outputElement.innerHTML += `<p class="fact">${fact.text}</p>`;
      });
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error(error);
    });
};
```

If you review it carefully…

- Can you understand it, reading each line carefully?
- Do you know what language it is, and where it could be run?
- Is it “front-end / client” or “back-end / server” code?
- Do you have an idea of what it might do, before even running it?
- Would you have known this months ago?
- Before you started at Lighthouse?
- Before you started programming?

## Where You're Going

Seniors don't know everything. They often just know how to get to an answer faster. They've learned how to learn, how to parse documentation and take the important bits quickly. If you do something everyday, sure you'll memorize the commands you use all the time, but more important than that in this forever shifting landscape is your ability to adapt.

Be willing to try, have something not work, and to try again. Experiment. `git commit`, break things, and roll back. Try things! Keep trying things until it works. Persistance and tenacity are the key.

## Be Proud

  - You HAVE written code that works.
  - You've built a project with a team.

  - You **ARE** a developer! Say it aloud, and let it sink in.
