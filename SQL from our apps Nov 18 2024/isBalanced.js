/*
  Given a str implement the isBalance function
  Your str will always be {}
  "{{{}}}" // true
  "}{}}{" // false
  "{}{}{}" // true
  "{{{{}" // false
  "{{}}}}}}}" // false
  "}{" // false
  "{}}{" // false

  "{"
  Your job is to write a function that check to see if the str is "Balanced " with the correct number of closing and opening curly at the same place

  "If the str is balanced return a true else false"

  "[]()"

  "{" or  "}" // false
  str.length is odd number // false
  "{" if the last item in the string is an opening { for sure it's false
  "}" if the first item is } then for sure it's false

  let count = 0;

{ + 1
} - 1

 Example the solution
 write it out step by step
